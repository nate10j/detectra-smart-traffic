This was meant to be a project for a school competition, but we lost. I am putting this up here to make some use of my work.

See also my unfinished [simulation](https://github.com/nate10j/detectra-simulation) when I tried to make a custom simulation to show the traffic light logic.

## Some background info...
This was meant to pitch an idea of smart traffic light systems. This was meant to reduce jaywalking, road injuries, and impatientness.
It was also meant to reduce constant stopping and starting, to make fuel usage more efficient to help the environment.

## Instructions
If you want to clone this repo, you have to provide the models yourself in onnx format. I did not provide the video input so you will have to find a video yourself.
Optionally, you can also choose to use webcams by putting VideoCapture to 1 or 2 (depends)
